# django Surveys

In this project, I attempted to build a Django app that runs a survey website following the blueprint by Matthew Segal from his [Blog Post](https://mattsegal.dev/django-survey-project.html).

On this website, users are able to sign up to create surveys and share them with others. The surveys will have questions, and each question will have answers. Users, anonymously, will be able to fill out the surveys with their responses. Users can fill out the survey infinitely. Should that be changed? Let me know.
